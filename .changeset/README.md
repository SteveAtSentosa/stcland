# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to use
Based on the scripts localed at the root `package.json`

### Requirements

Make sure to have all packages installed:

```
pnpm install
```

Create an `.env` file with your `NPM_TOKEN` variable so that the `.npmrc` file can consume it while publishing, make sure that it has permissions under the `stcland` organization.

### Creating a Changeset
```
pnpm create-changeset
```
Follow the prompts to specify the type of version bump(patch, minor, major) and describe the changes. Example input (automatically created under `.changeset`)

```
---
"@stcland/rest-hooks": patch
---

patch bumping test for rest-hooks

```

### Setting the Version

 Apply the version changes based on the changesets

 ```
 pnpm set-version
 ```

### Publishing Packages

Publish packages based on the changesets:

```
pnpm publish:changeset
```

For the first time you can also publish All Packages using this script:
```
pnpm publish:all
```
### Nice to know but not recommended

Under the `npm cli` if you want to unpublish a package use:

```
npm unpublish `@package/name@<version>`
```
